# baby-quant

This project simulates and visualizes the behavior of stock prices over time using Brownian motion and stochastic processes. It generates random walks and normal processes, applies them to simulate stock price movements, and plots these scenarios using matplotlib. Additionally, the project saves the simulated data to CSV files for further analysis or record-keeping.
